<h1>Travel Salesman Problem using GRASP </h1>
<br>

<p>Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure is a metaheuritic to solve optimisation problems, it consists of two phases :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial solution construction phase</li>
    <li>Solution improvment phase</li>
</ul>

<p>In this demo, we are implementing two approaches to get the best minimal distance for travel salesman problem using random approach and GRASP approach</p>
